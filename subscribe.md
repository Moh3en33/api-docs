# WebSocket

**Endpoint URL**

**`wss://data.wcex.com`**

## Subscribe

To receive WebSocket events, you must first send a `subscribe` message with the  channels you wish to subscribe to.

```javascript
{
  "type": "subscribe",
  "channels": [
    "exchange:quotes:XT-BTC",
    "exchange:book:XT-BTC",
    "trading:quotes:AAPL",
    "trading:quotes:EUR-USD"
  ]
}
```

You can unsubscribe in a similar fashion, by sending an `unsubscribe`message.

```javascript
{
  "type": "unsubscribe"
}
```

## Sequence Numbers

Events received through the WebSocket contain a `sequence` number. This is an integer value that will increase by 1 for each event sent for the duration of your connection.

You can ensure that you're receiving WebSocket messages in the expected order, and without dropped messages, by keeping track of the sequence numbers.

If you observe out of order sequence numbers, or dropped sequence numbers, you may need to disconnect and reconnect.

Each WebSocket connection keeps track of sequence numbers independently, so if you have multiple WebSocket connections open, keep in mind to track sequence numbers separately.

## Rate Limits

WebSocket `subscribe` and `unsubscribe` messages are rate limited to 1 per 5 seconds per IP.

If you're being rate-limited, you'll receive a response with type `error`.

## Authentication

To receive events from authenticated channels, you must authenticate when sending the initial `subscribe` message.

Authentication is similar to REST request signing and authentication. Pass in an `auth` field in your `subscribe` message containing:

* `key` Your API key \(you can use any API key on your Trading account\)
* `sig` The signed message for the `GET /ws-auth` request, with no body. See [Signing a Request](authentication.md#signing-a-request).
* `timestamp` The current time in milliseconds since UNIX epoch

```javascript
{
  "type": "subscribe",
  "channels": [
    "trading:quotes:EUR-USD",
    "trading:positions",
    "exchange:orders"
  ],
  "auth": {
    "key": "8b6bcdc6-5ef8-463b-833f-3681dc2c90d3",
    "sig": "5a1073b62e4dd62e4dd56244c89941...",
    "timestamp": 1511027890939
  }
}
```

## Channels & Events

**`heartbeat`**

WCX will send a `heartbeat` event every five seconds so you'll know your WebSocket connection is active. Hearbeats also include sequence numbers which you can use to check that no messages were missed.

If you miss one or more heartbeats, or your sequence numbers contain gaps, your connection may be unreliable. We recommend that you disconnect and reconnect.
